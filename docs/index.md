# Overview
CueLake does the `EL` in `ELT` (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines to a **data lakehouse**.

You write simple select statements to extract incremental data and schedule these statements. CueLake uses **Spark SQL** to execute these statements against your databases and then merges incremental data into your data lakehouse (powered by **Apache Iceberg**).

CueLake uses **Apache Zeppelin** to auto start and stop the Spark cluster. For every scheduled run, CueLake starts the Spark cluster, loads incremental data into the lakehouse, and then shuts down the cluster.

### What is a Lakehouse?
A lakehouse is a new, open architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and data warehouses (see Databricks articles [here](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html) and [here](https://databricks.com/research/lakehouse-a-new-generation-of-open-platforms-that-unify-data-warehousing-and-advanced-analytics)).

# Features
* **Upsert Incremental data.** CueLake uses Icebergâ€™s `merge into` query to automatically merge incremental data.
* **Elastically Scale Cloud Infrastructure.** CueLake uses Zeppelin to auto create and delete Kubernetes resources required to run data pipelines.
* **In-built Scheduler** to schedule your pipelines.
* **Automated maintenance of Iceberg tables.** CueLake does automated maintenance of Iceberg tables -  expires snapshots, removes old metadata and orphan files, compacts data files.
* **Monitoring.**  Get Slack alerts when a pipeline fails. CueLake maintains detailed logs.
* **Data Security.** Your data always stays within your cloud account.

### Current Limitations
* Supports relational databases (Oracle, MySQL, Postgres) as data source. More sources will be added later.
* Supports AWS S3 as a destination. Support for ADLS and GCS is in the roadmap.
* Uses Apache Iceberg as an open table format. Delta support is in the roadmap.
* Uses AWS Glue as the catalog implementation. Hive support is in the roadmap.
* Uses Celery for scheduling jobs. Support for Airflow is in the roadmap.
