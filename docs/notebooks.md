# Notebooks
In CueLake, you create a data pipeline by creating a new notebook. You can create a notebook from a template or create one from scratch using the blank template.

To schedule a notebook, assign a cron schedule to a notebook.

To view the history of previous runs of a notebook, click on Run History. Click on a run to view the detailed logs.
