# Notebooks
In CueLake, you create a data pipeline by creating a new notebook. You can create a notebook from a template or create one from scratch using the blank template.

## Notebook Form
When you choose a template, you enter the SQL and other details in a `Notebook Form`. CueLake uses this form to create the notebook.

## Schedule Notebook
To schedule a notebook, assign a cron schedule to a notebook.

## Run History
Run history shows all previous runs of a notebook, including the detailed logs.
